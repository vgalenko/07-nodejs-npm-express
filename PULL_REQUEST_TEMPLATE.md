#### Single-line Summary
**Today, John and Ron paired together. It took about 1 hr**

#### Reflect and summarize on your process for each `TODO` item :  
  1. The first thing we had to do was initialize npm.  This was done by running npm init in the terminal. This will ask you questions about the program and then create the package.json file.
  2. Then we installed node with terminal using npm i which adds the json file to our directory.
  3. After that we installed the express framework and the body-parser module.  This created dependencies in our package.json file.
  4. Next we added static pages to express so it could display our html.
  5. Then we console logged the port name in our terminal.
  6. Finally, we completed the stretch goal which allowed access to the new.html page with a url.
